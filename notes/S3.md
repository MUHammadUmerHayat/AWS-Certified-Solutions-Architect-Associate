# S3
---
S3 URL: httts://s3-region_name.amazonaws.com/bucket_name

- S3 is iobject based
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 tb
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets

**Data consistency model:**
- Read after write consistency model for PUTs of new Objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETE (can take some time to propogate)

**S3 is object based. object consist of following**
- **Key**: name of the object
- **value**: data
- **version id**: important for versioning
- **metadata**: data about data
- **subsources**:
	- ACL: access control list
	- Torrent: for torrenting the file

**S3 Guarantees and features**
- 99.99% availibility
- 99.99999999999% durability for s3 information
- Tiered storage available
- Life cycle management
- versioning
- Encryption
- MFA Delete
- Secure your data using ACL and Bucket Policies

Amazon S3 provides both coarse-grained access controls (Amazon S3 Access Control Lists [ACLs]), and fine-grained access controls (Amazon S3 bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM] policies, and query-string authentication).

Amazon S3 ACLs allow you to grant certain coarse-grained permissions: READ, WRITE, or FULL-CONTROL at the object or bucket level




- Secure your data using 
	IAM Policies
	Query String Authentication
	bucket policies: bucket level security
	CORS
	ACL: individual files
		- authenticated-read: owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The Authenticated Users Group Gets REAG access
		- bucket-owner-read: Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ access. If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
		- bucket-owner-full-control: Both the object owner and bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the bucket. If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
		- log-delivery-write: The LogDelivery group gets WRITE and READ_ACP permissions on the bucket.

##### CORS
---
- CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to intract with resources in a different domain.
- to configure CORS, you create an XML document with rules that identify the origins that you will allow to access your bucket.
- you can add upto 100 rules to the configuration.


---------------------------
S3 storage classes
---------------------------

##### S3 Standard:
* 99.99% availability
* 99.99999999999% durability
* stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the **loss of 2 facility concurrently**.
* AZ: >=3

##### S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed):
* For data that is accesses less frequently, but requirs rapid access when needed.
* Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrival fee.
* 99.9% availability
* AZ: >=3

##### S3 one zone IA:
* a lower cost option for infrequent accessed data but do not require the multiple availability zone data resilience.
* 99.5% availability
* AZ: >=1

#### S3 - Intelligent Tiering
Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tire, without perfrmance impact or operational overhead.
* AZ: >=3

#### Glacier:
- Very cheap, but is used for archival only.
- Expedited, standard or bulk.
- A standard retrival takes from minutes to hours
* AZ: >=3

#### Glacier deep archive:
- AWS S3 lowest cost storage class
- Used where 12 hours of retrieval time is acceptable
* AZ: >=3


#### Glacier Data Model

1. Vault:
	- A vault is a container for storing archives. When you create a vault, you specify a name and select an AWS region where you want to create the vault.
	- Each vault resource has a unique address
	- https://<region-specific endpoint>/<account id>/vaults/<vaultname>
	- you can store unlimited number of archives in a vault.
	- Each AWS account can have up to 1,000 vaults

2. Archives:
	- An archive can be any data such as photo, video or document and is a base unit of storage in AWS Glacier.
	- https://<region-specific endpoint>/<account id>/vaults/<vaultname>/archives/<archive-id>

3. Job:
	- Retrieving an archieve and vault inventory are asynchrnous operations in AWS Glacier in which you first initiate a Job, and then download the job output after Glacier completes the Job.
	- Data retrieval requests are queued and most jobs take about four hours to complete.

4. Notifiaction configuration:
	- you can configure a vault to send notification to SNS topic when job completes.
5. Vaults Locks:
	- You can easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual Amazon Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy. You can specify controls such as Write Once Read Many (WORM) in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.


##### Reduced Redundancy Storage
---
- RRS enables customers to reduce their cost by storing non-critical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than AWS S3 standard storage.
- 99.99% durability

Charges:
---
---
- 	storage
- 	requests
- 	storage management (tags, metadata)
- 	data transfer pricing
- 	Cross region replication:
    - Objects in a bucket in one region are replicated to other buckets inside other regions
- 	transfer acceleration:
    - Amazon s3 transfer acceleration enables fast easy and secure transfer of files over long distance between your end user and an s3 bucket.
    - transfer acceleration takes advantage of amazon aws cloudfronts globally distributed edge location, As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to amazon s3 over an optimized network path.

-------------------------------------

- Buckets are a universal namespace
- By default all the bucket are private
- Upload an object to s3 receives a HTTP 200 code
- s3, s3 IA, S3 reduced reduncency storage
- Amazon S3 is eventually consistent, but offers read-after-write consistency for new object PUTs.
---
**ENCRYPTION:**

---
* AT TRANSIT:
	SSL/TLS

* AT REST:
##### Client side encryption: 
			encryption at local system and upload to s3
##### Server side encryption
		- server side encryption with Amazon s3 management keys (SSE-s3)
		- server side encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)
		- server side encryption with customer provided keys (SSE-C)

--------------------------------------------------------
##### Range GETs
---
* It is possible to download (GET) only a portion of an object in both Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier by using something called a Range GET.
* Using the Range HTTP header in the GET request or equivalent parameters in one of the SDK wrapper libraries, you specify a range of bytes of the object. This can be useful in dealing with large objects when you have poor connectivity or to download only a known portion of a large Amazon Glacier backup.

----------------------**Cross Region Replicaiton**----------------------

- versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
- you cannot replicated to multiple buckets
- delete markers are NOT replicated
- If turned on in an existing bucket, cross-region replication will only replicate new objects. Existing objects will not be replicated and must be copied to the new bucket via a separate command.

----------------------**Life cycle management**----------------------
- can be used in conjuction with versioning
- can be applied to current version
- following actions can now be done:
	- transaction to the standard-IA access storage class (30 days after the creation date)
	- transaction to Glacier storage class (30 days after IA, if relevant)
	- permanently delete
-----

##### AWS S3 bucket Restrictions and Limitations:
---

- By default, you can create upto 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts.
- High-avalibility engineering of Amazon S3 id=s focused on get, put, list, and delete operations.
